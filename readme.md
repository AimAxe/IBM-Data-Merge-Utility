## What Is the IBM Data Merge Utility

The IBM Data Merge Utility is an open source general purpose Java utility, 
exposed as an HTTP service, that uses Templates with your data source to create 
one or more merge output files. The merge process is driven by a set of directives 
associated with a template.
